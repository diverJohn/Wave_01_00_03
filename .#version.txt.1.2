00.02.01 (12/11/14)
- Updated bluetoothle.js for IOS.  IOS has a different discovery method than Android.


00.02.02 (12/12/14)
- Updated antenna settings to control the UART redirect correctly.
- Changed navigator.notification.activityStart() to SpinnerStart() pluging since IOS
  does not support activityStart().   
- With the new spinner plugin the spinner can be fixed so they cannot be dismissed.
- Turned off full screen since it did not work on IOS.   However, IOS 7 and greater
  uses a transparent status bar so need additional logic for IOS 7 and greater.
  
00.02.03 (12/15/14) 
- Updated antenna settings to control the UART redirect correctly, again.


00.02.04 (12/17/14)
- Add vertical scrolling to registration.
- Hide status bar for IOS 7 and above.
- Added phone to required registration data.
- Added splash screen, www/splash.png.  Really a launch screen.
- Added download egress acknowledgement.
- Change to new SwVer numbering.
  From Louis email on 12/17/14:
    1)  For the PIC:
        Read the version as XYZZ hex, show this as 700N040-MMM-NNN (or 700.040.MMM.NNN where only digits are allowed), where MMM = hex2dec(Y) and NNN = hex2dex(ZZ), X is masked off and ignored for this purpose.
    2)  For BT:
        Read the version as XXYY BCD, show this as 700N041-0XX-0YY (or 700.041.0XX.0YY where only digits are allowed).
    3)  For Ares:
        If the version number reads 0x00500A, change this to 0x005010 and proceed to the next step
        Read the version as XXXYYY BCD, show this as 700N036-XXX-YYY (or 700.036.XXX.YYY where only digits are allowed).
  
00.02.05 (01/15/15)
  - Performed 128-bit UUID compare at the app level since Android BTLE internally does not compare 128-bit UUID.
    - This problem was discovered at a test lab with multiple 128-bit UUIDs and the app would connect to the first one found.
    - Also discovered that IOS does not filter for the 128-bit ID which makes me think that this is a plugin issue.  Filed bug with plugin.
    - Since IOS does not report the 128-bit IDs to the app I had to compare names, i.e. "Nextivity Bridge" for a match.
  - Added text at bottom of display to show which Cel-Fi MN:SN that this phone is connected to.
    - Had to add <meta name = "format-detection" content = "telephone=no"> to index.html to keep IOS from detecting the SN as a phone number.
  - Corrected location of progress bar on registration screen.
  - Changed progress bar text from "Cell Search Progress" to "Network Search Progress" to match NU LCD.
